detail:

Ambrose. in prpath, destination-specification=IP is handled as /32. which is
 not correct! Error when such route doest not exist in the DB. We must query fo r most specific route and consider it destination.???

Need to be checked.

In fact, we can't change the behaviour from current one. We may just add the warning, without exiting silently. 
Sug:
1. if AS -> take as AS-number.
2. if Prefix -> find originating AS-number.
3. if IP-addr OR Prefix which does not have "route" object - ???
	3a. query for most specific route, go to 2.
	3b. issue a warning to use only existing routes in IRR, and exit.

And anyways the question remains: how do we handle non-existing routes as destination-specification?

resume:
added small check for existence of originator. Need to ask someone, if this makes sence. New behaviour: if route is not existent, issue "unable to lookup destination AS", and exit.
Also this has been fixed for all non-existent routes.

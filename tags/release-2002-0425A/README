INSTALLATION
	0. To install, you need g++ 2.8.0 or higher, libstdc++-2.8.0 or
	   higher, bison, flex and gmake.
           Please note that the toolset is not gcc3 compliant (yet).

	   For roe and aoe, you also need Tk4.0/Tcl7.4 or higher. If Tcl/Tk 
	   is not installed in a standard include directory, please set the
	   environment variables as the following:
	     TCL_TK_INCLUDE_DIR to the : separated list of directories where 
	   tcl.h and tk.h include files can be found;
	     TCL_TK_LIBRARY_DIR to the : separated list of directories where 
	   tcl and tk libraries can be found;
	     TCL_LIBRARY to the location of the directory containing standard
	   library scripts (init.tcl and etc) for Tcl;
	     TK_LIBRARY to the location of the directory containing Tcl 
	   scripts (tk.tcl and etc) related to Tk;

	   For example:
  	      TCL_TK_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/tcl/include:/usr/local/tk/include
  	      TCL_TK_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/local/tcl/lib:/usr/local/tk/lib
	      TCL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/tcl7.6
	      TK_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/tk4.2

	   If Tk4.0/Tcl7.4 or higher can not be linked by simply adding -ltk
	   and -ltcl switches to the linker, please define the environment
	   variable LD_TCL_TK_LIBS to the appropriate value. For example:

	      LD_TCL_TK_LIBS="-ltk4.0 -ltcl4.0"

         Please make sure that tk is linked before tcl.

	   The development platform is a linux PC using gcc-2.95.3 and 
	   libstdc++-2.9.0. A statically-linked executables for various
	   platforms (well, we will try our best) can be provided upon
	   request. 

	1. unzip and untar the distribution file
	2. on RAToolSet directory, type `./configure' to configure the
	   package for your system. If you're using `csh' on an old
	   version of System V, you might need to type `sh ./configure'
	   instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure'
	   itself. The `--prefix=PREFIXDIR' option specifies where the
	   installation process should put RAToolSet and its data files.  
	   This defaults to `/usr/local'. 
	3. type "make depend" to generate the make file dependencies
	4. type "make all" to build RAToolSet.
	5. type "make install" to copy the executables/man-pages to
	   /usr/local/{bin,man} directory (or to the directory 
	   specified with --prefix argument to configure).

KNOWN PROBLEMS DURING INSTALLATION
	On Dec Alpha's running OSF/1, the make program seems to have
	problems, please try gnu make (often gmake).

	If you run into compilation problems on DU or AIX systems, and you 
	used --enable-debug option of configure, try not using that
	option. Older versions of gcc/g++ seems to have problems with
	these opitons on these platforms.

Please let us know if you face any problems at the mailing list
irrtoolset@ripe.net. Bug reports and suggestions are always welcome.

Version 4.8.4-HB2.3

* IRReval updates:
	enhancement of AS number representation ( options: -asn16 | -asdot | -asn32 )
	alternative configuration in the first input line
	man page updated

Version 4.8.4-HB2.2

* The RAWhoisClient have been extended to handle and pass on 32bit AS numbers correctly.

* Problems with uninitialized memory allocation in Buffer fixed.

Version 4.8.4-HB2.1

* The flex scanners (rpsl.l and command.l) have been extended to handle and pass on
  32bit AS numbers correctly.

  Valid notations are:
    16bit AS numbers-   "AS16" or "0.AS16"
    32bit AS numbers-   "AS32" or "AS16.AS16"

Version 4.8.4-HB2.0

* The flex scanners have been extended to handle and pass on 32bit AS numbers. Data
  structures carrying AS numbers were adjusted to store those numbers in unsigned int
  variables. By default however 32bit AS numbers are still translated into AS23456.

  Via a new option ("-asn32") IRReval users can decide to use 32bit AS numbers when
  generating as-path lists.

  The IRReval backends producing vendor specific as-path lists have been adjusted to
  produce appropriate code when 32bit AS numbers are used.

* When IRReval is used to produce RPSL route-set objects and address family is set to
  any, an empty line is produced between ipv4 and ipv6 prefixes which breaks the
  object. This problem was fixed.

Version 4.8.4-HB1.9

(applied patches: patch-485-17, patch-485-18)

* the irrd and ripe protocol implementations were extended and revised regarding the
  Proxy tunneling capability. irrd now supports a wider range of "HTTP 200" responses.
  The HTTP version used to communicate with the Proxy is now 1.1. Some optimizations
  were made in the code.

* the JunOS prefix-list filters produced by RtConfig and IRReval have been
  syntacticly changed to correct a difference in the semantics between the
  underlying RPSL expression and the produced JunOS prefix-list. For IRReval
  this affects IPv6 prefix-lists only.

* The IRReval man page was updated and corrected and moved from src/IRReval/IRReval.1 to
  man/man1/IRReval.1.

Version 4.8.4-HB1.8

(applied patches: patch-485-16)

* a syntax bug in IRReval, occurring when producing empty or complete JunOS
  prefix-filters was fixed.

Version 4.8.4-HB1.7

(applied patches: patch-485-11, patch-485-12, patch-485-13, patch-485-14,
                  patch-485-15)

* a bug in handling the "end of input" signal when executing IRReval in "rpsl"
  configuration format mode was fixed.

* the output format of RPSL objects generated by IRReval in "rpsl"
  configuration format mode was slightly changed to optimize the creation of
  IRR cache files from the generated objects.

* the lex scanner was enhanced to support 32bit AS numbers. After scanning any
  32bit AS number is translated into the 16bit AS number AS23456.

* a bug in reporting the discovery of IRR cache file objects with the same
  name was fixed.

* a bug in handling 32bit AS numbers when expanding RPSL as-set objects via the
  irrd protocol was fixed. (translation into 16bit AS23456)

Version 4.8.4-HB1.6

(applied patches: patch-485-10)

* a bug in the evaluation of negated route-set expressions containing IPv4 as
  well as IPv6 prefixes was fixed. 

* a bug in the "rpsl" config-format representation of IPv4 route-sets
  evaluating to ANY was fixed.

* a limitation in the representation of route-sets evaluating to ANY or NOT_
  ANY when the selected address family is "any", "any.unicast" or
  "any.multicast" was removed.

* the "restriction" routines used to restrict an RPSL expression to the
  specified address family were improved to speed up the process.

Version 4.8.4-HB1.5

(applied patches: patch-485-07, patch-485-08, patch-485-09)

* when IRReval is producing route-set objects in configuration format "rpsl"
  the IPv6 prefix lines are counted now and the total number of lines is
  printed in a comment line.

* the IRReval man page was updated to correctly document IRReval commands.

* error detection and reporting in the evaluation of RPSL cache file objects
  was upgraded and the pattern matching that detects the type of the object
  was tightened to correct a bug.

Version 4.8.4-HB1.4b

* negation of IPv6 route-sets in IOS XR and RPSL format was repaired in
  IRReval.

* warning messages are generated by default when a route-set evaluates to ANY
  or NOT ANY. This regards all kinds of configuration formats.

Version 4.8.4-HB1.4a

* negation of IPv4 route-sets in IOS XR and RPSL format was repaired in
  IRReval. 

Version 4.8.4-HB1.3

* cache file support was enabled for protocol irrd/rawhoisd

* instead of just reporting errors detected while scanning and parsing RPSL
  objects with lex and yack the program now terminates immediately after
  detection of the first error.

Version 4.8.4-HB1.2

* IRReval was adjusted to fit into the TROPOS v1.2 process chain.

* the work-around for the JunOS route list evaluation process
  problem from version 4.8.4-HB1.1 has been integrated in IRReval.

* a bug in the string manipulation of IOS as-path list definitions was fixed
  in RtConfig as well as in IRReval. 

Version 4.8.4-HB1.1

* For test cases a work-around for a problem with the JunOS route list
  evaluation process has been implemented in the JunOS prefix-filter printing
  routine. In class JunosConfig method printRoutes(SetOfPrefix& nets) (src/
  RtConfig/f_junos.cc) has been changed. Now this method generates a single
  term for each "route-filter" line. This is done to prevent prefix loss
  that occured at least for prefixes of length 24 in the following example:

      term prefixes {
         from {
           route-filter 0.0.0.0/0 upto /9 accept;
           route-filter 0.0.0.0/0 prefix-length-range /11-/24 accept;
           route-filter 128.0.0.0/1 prefix-length-range /10-/10 accept;
         }
      }

  The state before the work-around is saved in src/RtConfig/f_junos.cc.old

* A bug was fixed that inserted an unwanted Null character in a regular
  expression of an as-path list when generated by RtConfig as well as by
  IRReval. The cause was an "ends" command in the respective method wich was
  now deleted from

  - src/RtConfig/f_junos.cc
  - src/RtConfig/f_cisco.cc
  - src/IRReval/IOSConfig.cc
  - src/IRReval/JunosConfig.cc


Release Notes for IRRToolSet version 4.8.1
***************************************************

This release contains prototypes of RPSLng-aware tools from IRRToolSet: peval, rpslcheck and now RtConfig is added.

* RPSLng dictionary implemented according to the latest RPSLng draft:
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-blunk-rpslng-01.txt

* Tools have been tested to work with RIPE whois software. They will work also with irrd in most of the cases, as
  soon as irrd is updated to handle RPSLng-related objects. Separated patch for this may be necessary and will be
  available later.

* peval now accepts both RPSL and RPSLng filters (extended to support ipv6)
   for peval, the syntax for evaluation of mp-filter is:
  afi <afi_list> <mp-filter>
  results will be restricted to address familiy(ies) from <afi_list>.

* RtConfig has got a new command: '@RtConfig v6networks', which works symmetrically with '@RtConfig networks'. Other
  RtConfig commands have been modified to handle RPSLng.

There is a slightly complicated inderdependency of files in this directory.

class MLCG referenced by:
	Core/util/List.hh
	Core/sys/Time.cc

class Uniform referenced by:
	Core/util/List.hh
	Core/sys/Time.cc

class RNG referenced by:
	class MLCG
	class Uniform

class Random referenced by
	class RNG
	class Uniform

So, by removing MLCG and Uniform from Core/util/List.hh and
Core/sys/Time.cc, it was possible to remove classes MLCG, Uniform, RNG
and Random.

This confusing set of random number generators is used for a variety of
purposes including generating normal random numbers, weighted round-robin
comparison numbers, etc.

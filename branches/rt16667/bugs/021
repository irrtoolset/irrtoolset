summary: ifaddr in inet-rtr object works wrong for RtConfig 
owner: katie
status: wait
priority: high

detail:

command: @RtConfig configureRouter <inet-rtr-name>

inet-rtr:
ifaddr: x.x.x.x/x
peer: 

It converted x.x.x.x/x to x.x.x.x/32 and considere it and _only_ it as local interface address.
Tried to fix it by adding expansion to multiple /32's and selecting the policy from aut-num for each of these /32's.  However, not sure if this is right way of how ifaddr attribute works... Need to be considered.

Fixed. Now ifaddr is first /32. Iterator goes through all "ifaddr" attrs and all peers. 
Do we need to put 'interface' and extra neighbour statement there to understand how the peering is fully described???
done that.

(segm. fault problem is fixed)
